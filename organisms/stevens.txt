Professor Stevens: Welcome to the Stevens Institute of Pokémon! What brings you here to this fine establishment?
Professor Stevens: Oh! YOU wish to become a pokémon master and challenge the 1337 Four and the current pokémon master? Then you've come to the right place!
Professor Stevens: But first, you must choose a pokémon to become your eternal companion :O  What pokémon would you like?
Professor Stevens: !!
Professor Stevens: Ahh, charmeleon! A fine choice!
Professor Stevens: You'll need to become stronger and endure much training before you can face the mighty 1337 Four. 
Professor Stevens: To battle another trainer in order to gain experience, simply walk up and talk to them. Don't be shy! :)
Professor Stevens: Don't forget to talk to them again after you defeat them!
Professor Stevens: Also don't hesitate to investigate EVERYTHING around you. You never know what you may find ;]
Professor Stevens: Oh! Before you go, you might need this! There may not be Pokémon centers where you're headed ...
*allenjin acquires Fountan of Infinite Healitude*. Charmeleon will be back to full health after each battle.
Professor Stevens: Alright, I think you're all set. But before you begin your journey to become a pokémon master, you must first defeat me!

Professor Stevens: Allenjin! You're always welcome at SIP. If you ever need to research something, feel free to peruse these abundant resources. 
Professor Stevens: Don't forget to investigate other things too! ;]
Professor Stevens: Good luck on your journey to become a pokémon master!
