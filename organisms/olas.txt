Olas: Eh? A visitor!? ... Aren't you the volleyball guy? 
Olas: YOU ARE! ALLENJIN! I've heard so much of your legendary volleyball skills!
Olas: Hey, will you teach me volleyball? I would love to learn... All I can do is swim...
Olas: What?! You can't swim? 
Olas: How about I teach you how to swim ... and you could teach me to volleyball?
Olas: YAY! But first, you should show me your Charmeleon :D

Olas: I've taught you all you need to know about swimming. Go test out your skills in the ocean ;]
